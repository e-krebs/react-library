# how to use (‚ö†Ô∏è alpha version ‚ö†Ô∏è)
```
yarn add @e-krebs/react-library

**Typescript** types are included with the package.

The components can then be imported from the root of the package:
```ts
import { Checkbox, TextInput } from '@e-krebs/react-library'
```

in addition the the components, you can import the tailwindcss preset from the package:
- `tailwind.config.js`
- in which case, don't forget to include this package files in your tailwind content declaration

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const shared = require('@e-krebs/react-library/tailwind.config.js');
module.exports = {
  presets: [shared],
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,ts,tsx}", "./node_modules/@e-krebs/react-library/dist/**/*.js"],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  }
}
```
